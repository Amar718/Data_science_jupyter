    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with estimating population parameters based on sample statistics. Point estimate is a single value estimate of the population parameter, while interval estimate is a range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter with a certain level of confidence.\n",

    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population. It is used to test a hypothesis by comparing the observed data to what would be expected if the hypothesis were true. The importance of hypothesis testing lies in its ability to provide a framework for making decisions based on data.\n",

    "To conduct a hypothesis test on the difference between two population means, given a sample from each population, you can use a two-sample t-test. Here's an example Python script that demonstrates how to do this:\n",

    "from scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n",

    "The steps involved in hypothesis testing are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. State the null and alternative hypotheses.\n",
    "2. Determine the appropriate test statistic and significance level.\n",
    "3. Collect data and calculate the test statistic.\n",
    "4. Determine the p-value.\n",
    "5. Make a decision based on the p-value and significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed value, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. It represents the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. A small p-value (less than the significance level) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis and suggests that we should reject it in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",

    "The Student’s t distribution is used when we want to estimate an unknown population mean from a sample mean when we don’t know the population standard deviation. It’s also used when we have small sample sizes (less than 30) and when we want to test hypotheses about population means."
