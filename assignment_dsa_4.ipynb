    "1.The General Linear Model (GLM) is a useful framework for comparing how several variables affect different continuous variables. It is mathematically identical to a multiple regression analysis but stresses its suitability for both multiple qualitative and multiple quantitative variables². \n",
    "\n",
    "2.The key assumptions of the General Linear Model are that the residuals are normally distributed, homoscedastic (constant variance), and independent⁴. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.The coefficients in a GLM represent the change in the dependent variable for each unit increase in the independent variable while holding all other independent variables constant³. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.A univariate GLM has only one dependent variable while a multivariate GLM has more than one dependent variable⁵. \n",
    "\n",
    "5.Interaction effects in a GLM occur when the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable depends on the level of another independent variable¹. \n",
    "\n",
    "6.Categorical predictors can be handled in a GLM by using dummy coding or effect coding². \n",
    "\n",
    "7.The design matrix in a GLM is used to represent the data in matrix form and is used to estimate the coefficients of the model¹. \n",
    "\n",
    "8.The significance of predictors in a GLM can be tested using hypothesis tests such as t-tests or F-tests². \n",
    "\n",
    "9.Type I, Type II, and Type III sums of squares are methods for partitioning the sum of squares into components that correspond to different sources of variation in the data. Type I sums of squares are used when predictors are entered into the model sequentially. Type II sums of squares are used when predictors are entered into the model simultaneously. Type III sums of squares are used when predictors are categorical and there is no natural ordering among them². \n",

    "10.Deviance is a measure of how well the model fits the data. It is calculated as minus twice the log-likelihood ratio between two models, with one model being a reduced model and another being a full model².\n",
    "\n",
    "11.Regression analysis is a statistical method used to understand the relationships between variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "12.Simple linear regression has only one x and one y variable. It establishes the relationship between two variables using a straight line. It attempts to draw a line that comes closest to the data by finding the slope and intercept which define the line and minimize regression errors¹². Multiple linear regression has one y and two or more x variables. It allows evaluating the relationship between two variables while controlling for the effect (i.e., removing the effect) of other variables³.\n",
    "\n",
    "13.The R-squared value is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model explains none of the variability in the dependent variable and 1 indicates that it explains all of it⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "14.Correlation measures the strength of association between two variables while regression analysis is used to establish the relationship between two variables⁴. The coefficients in regression represent how much change occurs in the dependent variable when an independent variable changes by one unit while intercept represents the value of dependent variable when all independent variables are zero⁴. \n",
    "\n",
    "15.Outliers can be handled by removing them or transforming them⁶. Ridge regression is used when there is multicollinearity among independent variables. \n",

    "21. A loss function is a mathematical function that measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output in machine learning models. The purpose of a loss function is to optimize the model's parameters so that it can make accurate predictions on new data. ¹\n",
    "\n",
    "22. A convex loss function is a function whose Hessian matrix is positive semi-definite for all values of its input variables. A non-convex loss function is a function whose Hessian matrix is not positive semi-definite for all values of its input variables. ¹\n",
    "\n",
    "23. Mean squared error (MSE) is a commonly used loss function in regression problems that measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual target values. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. ²\n",
    "\n",
    "24. Mean absolute error (MAE) is another commonly used loss function in regression problems that measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual target values. It is calculated by taking the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. ²\n",
    "\n",
    "25. Log loss (cross-entropy loss) is a commonly used loss function in classification problems that measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual probabilities of each class. It is calculated by taking the negative logarithm of the predicted probability for each class and summing them up. ²\n",
    "\n",
    "26. The appropriate loss function for a given problem depends on several factors such as the type of problem (regression or classification), the distribution of data, and the desired outcome (accuracy or interpretability). ¹\n",
    "\n",
    "27. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large weights in the model's parameters. This helps to reduce variance in the model and improve its generalization performance on new data. ¹\n",
    "\n",
    "28. Huber loss is a loss function that combines properties of both mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) by using a delta parameter that controls how much error should be tolerated before switching from MSE to MAE. It handles outliers better than MSE because it is less sensitive to them due to its linear behavior for large errors. ¹\n",
    "\n",
    "29. Quantile loss is a loss function that measures the difference between two quantiles of predicted and actual values instead of their absolute or squared differences. It is used when we want to predict quantiles instead of point estimates in regression problems. ¹\n",
    "\n",
    "30. Squared loss and absolute loss are both used as loss functions in regression problems but differ in how they measure error between predicted and actual values. Squared loss measures error as squared differences between predicted and actual values while absolute loss measures error as absolute differences between predicted and actual values. Squared loss gives more weight to large errors while absolute loss treats all errors equally regardless of their magnitude.²\n",

    "31. An optimizer is an algorithm that is used to minimize the loss function by adjusting the weights and biases of a neural network during training. The purpose of an optimizer is to find the optimal set of weights and biases that will minimize the loss function. Gradient Descent (GD) is one such optimizer used in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "32. Gradient Descent (GD) is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to minimize the loss function by iteratively adjusting the weights and biases of a neural network. It works by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases and then updating them in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "33. There are different variations of Gradient Descent such as Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "34. The learning rate in GD determines how much we update the weights and biases during each iteration. Choosing an appropriate value for the learning rate is important because if it is too small, it will take a long time for the algorithm to converge, and if it is too large, it may overshoot the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "35. GD handles local optima in optimization problems by using momentum-based optimization techniques such as Momentum-based Gradient Optimizer which accelerates convergence of the algorithm and overcomes local minima¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "36. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a variation of GD that updates the weights and biases after each training example instead of after each epoch. It differs from GD in that it uses a random subset of training examples at each iteration instead of using all training examples at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "37. Batch size in GD refers to the number of training examples used in each iteration to update the weights and biases. The impact of batch size on training depends on several factors such as dataset size, model complexity, and available computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "38. Momentum is a technique used in optimization algorithms such as GD to accelerate convergence by dampening oscillations¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "39. Batch GD updates the weights and biases using all training examples at once, Mini-Batch GD updates them using a small subset of training examples at each iteration, while SGD updates them after each training example.\n",
    "\n",
    "40. The learning rate affects the convergence of GD because if it is too small, it will take a long time for the algorithm to converge, while if it is too large, it may overshoot the minimum⁵.\n",
    "\n",
    "41.Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data and performs poorly on the test data. Regularization helps reduce the influence of noise on the model’s predictive performance by adding extra information to the dataset³⁴⁵.\n",
    "\n",
    "42.There are two types of regularization techniques: L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge). L1 regularization adds an absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients as a penalty term to the loss function. L2 regularization adds a squared magnitude of coefficients as a penalty term to the loss function. The difference between L1 and L2 regularization is that L1 regularization can lead to sparse models where some coefficients are zero while L2 regularization does not⁵⁶.\n",
    "\n",
    "43.Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that uses L2 regularization. It adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. Ridge regression helps reduce overfitting by shrinking the coefficients towards zero⁵.\n",
    "\n",
    "44.Elastic net regularization is a combination of L1 and L2 penalties. It adds both penalties to the loss function. Elastic net regularization helps reduce overfitting by shrinking some coefficients towards zero while keeping others large⁵.\n",
    "\n",
    "45.Early stopping is another technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting. It involves stopping the training process when the performance on the validation set starts decreasing³.\n",

    "\n",
    "47.The choice of regularization parameter depends on the problem at hand and can be determined using cross-validation³.\n",
    "\n",
    "48.Feature selection is different from regularization in that it involves selecting a subset of features that are most relevant to the problem at hand while regularization involves adding extra information to the dataset³.\n",
    "\n",
    "49.Regularization helps balance bias and variance in machine learning models. Bias refers to how well a model fits the training data while variance refers to how well it generalizes to new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "50.Regularization helps reduce variance at the cost of increasing bias³⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "51.Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a relatively simple Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm used for classification and/or regression. It is more preferred for classification but is sometimes very useful for regression as well. Basically, SVM finds a hyper-plane that creates a boundary between the types of data. The hyperplane with maximum margin is called the optimal hyperplane⁴. \n",
    "\n",
    "52.The kernel trick is used to transform data that is not linearly separable in its original form into a higher-dimensional space where it can be linearly separated. This transformation is done by applying a kernel function to the data⁵. \n",
    "\n",
    "53.Support vectors are the data points or vectors that are the closest to the hyperplane and which affect the position of the hyperplane. Since these vectors support the hyperplane, hence called a Support vector⁹. \n",
    "\n",
    "54.The margin in SVM refers to the distance between the decision boundary and the closest points of each class. The goal of SVM is to maximize this margin⁴. \n",
    "\n",
    "55.To handle unbalanced datasets in SVM, we can use techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using weighted SVM³. \n",
    "\n",
    "56.Linear SVM works well when there is a linear relationship between input variables and output variable. Non-linear SVM works well when there is no linear relationship between input variables and output variable. Non-linear SVM uses kernel functions to transform data into higher dimensions where it can be separated by a linear boundary¹. \n",
    "\n",
    "57.The C-parameter in SVM controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error. A smaller value of C creates a wider margin but more errors on training data while a larger value of C creates a narrower margin but fewer errors on training data¹. \n",
    "\n",
    "58.Slack variables are introduced in SVM to allow some misclassifications in order to achieve better generalization performance⁸. \n",
    "\n",
    "59.Hard margin SVM only works when the dataset is linearly separable. Soft margin SVM allows some misclassifications to achieve better generalization performance⁹.\n",
    "\n",
    "60.The coefficients in an SVM model represent the weights assigned to each feature in the dataset. These weights indicate how important each feature is for predicting the target variable³.\n",
    "\n",
    "61.A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label¹. Decision trees can be used to solve both regression and classification problems².\n",
    "\n",
    "62.Impurity measures are used in decision trees to determine the usefulness of a feature by partitioning the dataset into more homogeneous subsets with respect to the class labels or target variable. In classification, entropy is used as a measure of impurity, while in regression, variance is used as a measure of impurity. The information gain calculation remains the same in both cases, except that entropy or variance is used instead of entropy in the formula¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "63.Information gain measures the reduction in entropy or variance that results from splitting a dataset based on a specific property. It is used in decision tree algorithms to determine the usefulness of a feature by partitioning the dataset into more homogeneous subsets with respect to the class labels or target variable¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "64.Pruning is an important technique used in decision trees to avoid overfitting. It involves removing branches that do not provide any useful information and can lead to overfitting¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "65.Classification trees are used when the target variable is categorical and regression trees are used when the target variable is continuous¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "66.The decision boundaries in a decision tree are interpreted as regions where all instances have the same predicted class. The boundaries are perpendicular to one of the axes of the feature space¹.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "71.Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning to improve the performance of a model. They combine multiple models to produce a better model. There are several ensemble techniques such as bagging, boosting, random forests and stacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "72.Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is a technique that tries to implement similar learners on small sample populations and then takes a mean of all the predictions. It combines Bootstrapping and Aggregation to form one ensemble model. Bagging algorithms include Bagging meta-estimator and Random forest ²⁵.\n",
    "\n",
    "73.Boosting is another ensemble technique that is mostly used to reduce the bias in a model. It trains weak models sequentially and tries to correct the errors of the previous models by giving more weight to misclassified samples. AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting are two popular boosting algorithms ⁵⁶.\n",
    "\n",
    "74.Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees, implementing the bagging method and results in a robust model (Classifier or Regressor) with low variance ³⁵.\n",
    "\n",
    "75.Stacking is another ensemble technique that combines multiple models using another model called meta-model. It uses the predictions of base models as input features for the meta-model. The meta-model then learns from these features and produces the final prediction ¹⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "77.The advantages of ensemble techniques include improved accuracy, reduced overfitting, better generalization, and robustness. However, they can be computationally expensive and may require more data than single models ⁵.\n",
    "\n",
    "80.To choose the optimal number of models in an ensemble, you can use cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation or leave-one-out cross-validation ⁵.\n",
