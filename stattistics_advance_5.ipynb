    "Q1. To calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample of data with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5, you can use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidence Interval = x +/- t*(s/√n)**\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- x: sample mean\n",
    "- t: t-value that corresponds to the confidence level\n",
    "- s: sample standard deviation\n",
    "- n: sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the **scipy.stats** module to find the t-value for a given confidence level and degrees of freedom. For example, for a 95% confidence level and n-1 degrees of freedom, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from scipy import stats\n",
    "t = stats.t.ppf(0.975, n-1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can plug in the values into the formula to get the confidence interval. For example, for a sample size of 20, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 50\n",
    "s = 5\n",
    "n = 20\n",
    "t = stats.t.ppf(0.975, n-1)\n",
    "lower = x - t * (s / np.sqrt(n))\n",

    "```\n",
    "The 95% confidence interval is (46.82, 53.18)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "Q2. To conduct a chi-square goodness of fit test to determine if the distribution of colors of M&Ms in a bag matches the expected distribution of 20% blue, 20% orange, 20% green, 10% yellow, 10% red, and 20%\n",
    "brown, you can use the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Count the number of M&Ms of each color in the bag and store them in an array. For example, if you have 100 M&Ms and you observe 18 blue, 22 orange, 19 green, 11 yellow, 9 red, and 21 brown, you can use:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate the expected frequencies of each color based on the expected proportions and store them in another array. For example, if you have 100 M&Ms and you expect 20% blue, 20% orange, 20% green, 10% yellow, 10% red, and 20%\n",
    "brown, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "- Use the **scipy.stats.chisquare** function to perform the chi-square test and get the chi-square statistic and p-value. For example:\n",

    "chi2_stat, p_value = stats.chisquare(observed, expected)\n",
    "print(f\"The chi-square statistic is {chi2_stat:.2f} and the p-value is {p_value:.4f}\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The chi-square statistic is 3.60 and the p-value is 0.6079\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare the p-value with the significance level (alpha) to draw a conclusion. For example, if alpha is 0.05,\n",

    "```\n",
    "We fail to reject the null hypothesis that the observed frequencies match the expected frequencies.\n",

    "Q4. To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of individuals in the population who smoke, you can use the following Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import statsmodels.api as sm\n",

    "\n",
    "This will print out the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval as a tuple, which are approximately (0.09, 0.15). This means that we are 95% confident that the true proportion of individuals in the population who smoke is between 9% and 15%.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import scipy.stats as st\n",
    "mean = 75 # sample mean\n",
    "sd = 12 # sample standard deviation\n",

    "print(ci)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will print out the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval as a tuple, which are approximately (72.6, 77.4). This means that we are 90% confident that the true mean of the population is between 72.6 and 77.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "To interpret the results, we can say that if we repeated this sampling process many times, 90% of the confidence intervals we obtain would contain the true population\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. To plot the chi-square distribution with 10 degrees of freedom using Python, you can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import scipy.stats as st\n",
    "x = np.linspace(0, 30, 100) # range of x values\n",
    "y = st.chi2.pdf(x, 10) # chi-square probability density function\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y) # plot the curve\n",
    "plt.xlabel('Chi-square statistic') # label the x-axis\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Probability density') # label the y-axis\n",
    "plt.fill_between(x, y, where=x >= 15, color='red', alpha=0.5) # shade the area where x >= 15\n",
