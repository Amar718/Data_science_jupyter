    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "- Flask is lightweight and easy to learn.\n",
    "- Flask is highly customizable.\n",
    "- Flask is integrated with Jinja2 templating engine which makes it easy to write HTML templates.\n",
    "- Flask has a built-in development server and debugger.\n",
    "- Flask supports unit testing.\n",
    "- Flask is compatible with Google App Engine².\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "- Flask is not suitable for large applications because it lacks the functionality of large frameworks like Django.\n",
    "- Flask does not have built-in support for database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions²⁴.\n",

    "App routing in Flask refers to the process of directing a user's request to the appropriate handler function. In other words, it maps URLs to handler functions. We use app routes in Flask to define the URL patterns for our web application¹.\n",
