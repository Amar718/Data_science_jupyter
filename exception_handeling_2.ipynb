    "Q1. The Exception class is used as the base class for all the exceptions in Python. When creating a custom exception, we inherit from the Exception class to create our own exception. This allows us to define our own error messages and error handling¹².\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Here is an example Python program that prints the Python Exception Hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import inspect\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_exception_hierarchy():\n",
    "    for name, obj in inspect.getmembers(__builtins__):\n",
    "        if inspect.isclass(obj):\n",
    "            if issubclass(obj, BaseException):\n",
    "                print(name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. The ArithmeticError class is the base class for all errors associated with arithmetic operations. Some of the errors defined in this class are ZeroDivisionError, OverflowError and FloatingPointError⁹. \n",
    "\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError occurs when we try to divide a number by zero. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = 1 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught an exception:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "OverflowError occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented by a finite number in Python. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = math.exp(1000)\n",
    "except OverflowError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught an exception:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. The LookupError class is used as the base class for all exceptions that are raised when an index or a key is not found for a sequence or dictionary respectively. Two examples of such exceptions are KeyError and IndexError.\n",
    "\n",
    "KeyError occurs when we try to access a dictionary key that does not exist. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = d[\"c\"]\n",
    "except KeyError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught an exception:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "IndexError occurs when we try to access an index that is out of range for a sequence. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = l[3]\n",
    "except IndexError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught an exception:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. ImportError occurs when there is an error while importing a module in Python. ModuleNotFoundError is a subclass of ImportError that is raised when a module could not be found⁵.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Some best practices for exception handling in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use exceptions instead of returning error codes.\n",
    "- Handle exceptions at the appropriate level.\n",
    "- Be specific about which exceptions you catch.\n",
    "- Use finally blocks to release resources.\n",
    "- Use context managers to simplify resource management.\n",
    "- Log exceptions and their stack traces.\n",
    "- Define your own exception hierarchy¹⁴."
