    "Q1. To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between two variables, you need to use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pearson correlation coefficient = ρ (x,y) = Σ (xi – x̄) (yi – ȳ) / σx*σy**\n",
    "\n",
    "where x̄ is the mean of x variable, ȳ is the mean of y variable, σx is the standard deviation of x variable, and σy is the standard deviation of y variable¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, 0 indicates no linear relationship, and 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "To interpret the result, you need to compare the calculated value of ρ (x,y) with the critical value of r for your sample size and significance level. You can find the critical value of r in a table or use an online calculator³. If the absolute value of ρ (x,y) is greater than or equal to the critical value of r, then you can conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. To calculate the Spearman's rank correlation between two variables, you need to use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spearman's rank correlation = rs = 1 - 6Σd^2 / n(n^2 - 1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "where d is the difference between the ranks of each pair of values, and n is the number of pairs⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spearman's rank correlation measures the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables. It also ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative monotonic relationship, 0 indicates no monotonic relationship, and 1 indicates a perfect positive monotonic relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "To interpret the result, you need to compare the calculated value of rs with the critical value of r for your sample size and significance level. You can find the critical value of r in a table or use an online calculator³. If the absolute value of rs is greater than or equal to the critical value of r, then you can conclude that there is a significant monotonic relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman's rank correlation between two variables, you need to use the same formulas as in Q1 and Q2. However, you also need to check if your data meets some assumptions before using these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient assumes that both variables are normally distributed, have a linear relationship, and have homoscedasticity (i.e., equal variances)⁵. The Spearman's rank correlation does not require these assumptions and can be used for ordinal or non-normal data⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare the results, you need to look at both the magnitude and direction of the correlation coefficients. If they are similar, it means that both variables have a linear and monotonic relationship. If they are different, it means that either one or both variables are not normally distributed, or that they have a nonlinear or non-monotonic relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between two variables, you need to use the same formula as in Q1. However, you also need to check if your data meets some assumptions before using this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient assumes that both variables are normally distributed, have a linear relationship, and have homoscedasticity (i.e., equal variances)⁵. If these assumptions are violated, you may get a misleading result.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check these assumptions, you can use graphical methods such as histograms, scatterplots, and residual plots⁵. You can also use statistical tests such as Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, F-test for homoscedasticity, and linearity test for linearity⁵.\n",
