    "Q1. Probability density function (PDF) is a function that describes the relative likelihood for this random variable to take on a given value. It is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values, as opposed to taking on any one value. ¹ \n",

    "Q2. There are many types of probability distributions. Some of them are:\n",
    "- Uniform Distribution\n",
    "- Normal Distribution\n",
    "- Binomial Distribution\n",
    "- Poisson Distribution\n",
    "- Exponential Distribution\n",
    "- Gamma Distribution\n",
    "- Beta Distribution\n",
    "- Lognormal Distribution ²\n",

    "Q7. The main difference between Binomial and Poisson distributions is that Binomial distribution is used when there are a fixed number of trials and each trial has only two possible outcomes whereas Poisson distribution is used when there are an infinite number of trials and each trial has only one possible outcome.\n",
