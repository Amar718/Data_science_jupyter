    "Python's **multiprocessing** module is used to create and manage new child processes in Python⁶. It allows you to execute multiple processes concurrently¹¹. Multiprocessing is useful when you want to run multiple processes in parallel on different CPU cores¹³. It is also useful when you want to run CPU-bound tasks that require a lot of processing power¹³. \n",

    "The main differences between multiprocessing and multithreading are that multiprocessing uses separate memory spaces for each process while multithreading uses the same memory space for all threads¹². Multiprocessing is better suited for CPU-bound tasks while multithreading is better suited for I/O-bound tasks¹⁵.\n",
