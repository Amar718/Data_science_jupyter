    "\n",
    "Summary: An F-test is used to test whether two population variances are equal. The null and alternative hypotheses for the test are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "H0: σ1^2 = σ2^2 (the population variances are equal)\n",
    "\n",
    "H1: σ1^2 ≠ σ2^2 (the population variances are not equal)\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-value is calculated as the ratio of the sample variances:\n",
    "\n",
    "F = s1^2 / s2^2\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is calculated as the probability of obtaining an F-value equal or more extreme than the observed one, assuming the null hypothesis is true. The p-value can be obtained from the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the F-distribution with degrees of freedom df1 = n1 - 1 and df2 = n2 - 1, where n1 and n2 are the sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible Python function to perform the F-test is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from scipy.stats import f\n",

    "Summary: A critical F-value is the value of the F-statistic that corresponds to a certain significance level and degrees of freedom. It is used to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis in an F-test. A two-tailed test means that we consider both the upper and lower tails of the F-distribution.\n",
