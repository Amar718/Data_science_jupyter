    "Q1: **Overfitting** is when a machine learning model learns too much from the training data and fails to generalize well to new or unseen data. **Underfitting** is when a machine learning model learns too little from the training data and fails to capture the underlying pattern or complexity of the data. Both overfitting and underfitting can lead to poor model performance. They can be mitigated by using appropriate data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, regularization, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning techniques¹²³.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: We can reduce overfitting by using methods such as regularization, dropout, data augmentation, early stopping, ensemble methods, etc. These methods help to reduce the complexity of the model, introduce randomness or noise, increase the diversity of the data, or combine multiple models to prevent overfitting¹²³.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: **Underfitting** is when a machine learning model is unable to learn the relevant features or relationships from the training data. It can occur when the model is too simple, the data is too noisy, the features are irrelevant, or the hyperparameters are poorly chosen¹²⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: The **bias-variance tradeoff** is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the tradeoff between the error due to bias and the error due to variance. **Bias** is the difference between the expected prediction of the model and the true value. **Variance** is the variability of the model prediction for a given data point. A high bias model tends to underfit the data, while a high variance model tends to overfit the data. The goal is to find a balance between bias and variance that minimizes the total error¹²³.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Some common methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting in machine learning models are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plotting learning curves: Learning curves show how the training and validation errors change with respect to the number of training examples or epochs. If the training error is low but the validation error is high, it indicates overfitting. If both the training and validation errors are high, it indicates underfitting¹².\n",
    "- Using cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique that splits the data into multiple folds and trains and tests the model on each fold. It helps to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data and avoid overfitting or underfitting¹²³.\n",
    "- Comparing different models: Comparing different models with different complexities, architectures, or hyperparameters can help to identify which model fits the data best and avoid overfitting or underfitting¹²³.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether your model is overfitting or underfitting, you can compare the training and validation errors or scores. If your model has a low training error but a high validation error, it is overfitting. If your model has a high training error and a low validation error, it is underfitting¹².\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: **Bias** and **variance** are two sources of error in machine learning models. Bias measures how far off the average prediction of the model is from the true value. Variance measures how much the predictions vary for different data points. A high bias model tends to be simple and rigid, while a high variance model tends to be complex and flexible¹²³.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of high bias and high variance models are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High bias models: Linear regression, logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision stumps, etc. These models tend to have low complexity, low flexibility, and high assumptions about the data. They often perform poorly on complex or nonlinear data sets¹²⁴.\n",
    "- High variance models: Neural networks, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, etc. These models tend to have high complexity, high flexibility, and low assumptions about the data. They often perform well on complex or nonlinear data sets but may suffer from overfitting if not regularized or tuned properly¹²⁴.\n",
