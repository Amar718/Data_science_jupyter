    "Q1. The keyword used to create a function in Python is `def`. Here's an example of a function that returns a list of odd numbers in the range of 1 to 25:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def odd_numbers():\n",
    "    return [i for i in range(1, 26) if i % 2 != 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. `*args` and `**kwargs` are used in Python functions to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. `*args` is used to pass a non-keyworded, variable-length argument list while `**kwargs` allows you to pass keyworded variable-length argument lists. Here are examples of functions that demonstrate their use:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_sum(*args):\n",
    "    return sum(args)\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_dict(**kwargs):\n",
    "    return kwargs\n",

    "Q3. An iterator is an object that can be iterated (looped) upon. In Python, an iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol (which consists of the methods `__iter__()` and `__next__()`). The `__iter__()` method initializes the iterator object and returns the object itself while the `__next__()` method returns the next value from the iterator. Here's an example of how to initialize an iterator object and iterate over it:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]\n",
    "my_iterator = iter(my_list)\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(next(my_iterator))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. A generator function is a function that returns an iterator object (a generator) which can be iterated over (one value at a time). The `yield` keyword is used in generator functions to return values one at a time. Here's an example of a generator function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def prime_numbers():\n",
    "    n = 2\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        for i in range(2, n):\n",
    "            if n % i == 0:\n",
    "                break\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            yield n\n",
    "        n += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Here's an example of a generator function for prime numbers less than 1000 and how to use the `next()` method to print the first 20 prime numbers:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def prime_numbers():\n",
    "    n = 2\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        for i in range(2, n):\n",
    "            if n % i == 0:\n",
    "                break\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            yield n\n",
    "        n += 1\n",
    "\n",

    "for i in range(20):\n",
