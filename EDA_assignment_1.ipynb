    "The wine quality data set contains 11 physicochemical features and one sensory feature of red and white wines. The physicochemical features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- fixed acidity: the amount of tartaric acid in g/dm3\n",
    "- volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in g/dm3\n",
    "- citric acid: the amount of citric acid in g/dm3\n",
    "- residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation in g/dm3\n",
    "- chlorides: the amount of salt in g/dm3\n",
    "- free sulfur dioxide: the amount of free SO2 in mg/dm3\n",
    "- total sulfur dioxide: the amount of free and bound SO2 in mg/dm3\n",
    "- density: the density of wine in g/ml\n",
    "- pH: the acidity or alkalinity of wine on a scale of 0 to 14\n",
    "- sulphates: the amount of sulphates in g/dm3\n",
    "- alcohol: the alcohol content in % vol\n",
    "\n",
    "The sensory feature is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- quality: the quality rating given by human experts on a scale of 0 to 10\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of each feature in predicting the quality of wine depends on the type of wine (red or white) and the method of prediction (regression or classification). However, some general trends can be observed from previous studies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alcohol, volatile acidity, sulphates, and residual sugar tend to have positive correlations with wine quality, meaning that higher values of these features are associated with higher quality ratings.\n",
    "- Density, chlorides, and total sulfur dioxide tend to have negative correlations with wine quality, meaning that lower values of these features are associated with higher quality ratings.\n",
    "- Fixed acidity, citric acid, free sulfur dioxide, and pH tend to have weak or no correlations with wine quality, meaning that they do not have a significant impact on the quality ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "These correlations may vary depending on the data preprocessing, feature selection, and modeling techniques used. Therefore, it is advisable to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering before building a predictive model.\n",
